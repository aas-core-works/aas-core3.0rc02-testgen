0.0.1 (2022-06-19)
==================
This is the initial version of the code. So far, we generate only JSON
data based on aas-core-meta 2022.6.19 and aas-core-codegen 0.0.13.

The code generated by aas-core-codegen passes all the tests with the
JSON data.

The generation of XML data, and the corresponding changes, are still
pending.
